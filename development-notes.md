This repository is being developed on the `development` branch. The `master` branch is for releases. The documentation GitHub action is triggered on the `master` branch and on creating tags.  In order to avoid making the `github-pages` branch very large, develop commits on the `development` branch and merge them before making a release using pull requests. Remember to tag the release with a propert tag. The "Documenter.jl" creates GitHub pages for every tag and for the latest version.
